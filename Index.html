      <!-- paragraph 1 -->
       <p>Once upon a time, Manali was a backpacking capital of India. A dirt track from Manali to Kullu was part of the popular hippie trail. Today it is tough to imagine Manali as a backpacker’s paradise. It has easily become one of the most popular hill stations in India with tourists thronging to Manali in the height of summer as well as winter.</p>
       <!-- <br> -->
       <p>One of the most popular tourist places in Northern India is situated in Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh on the banks of Beas River and at an altitude of 1950 Meters or 6500 Feet (approximately) Manali, Valley of Gods. The term stands for Manu (Manu Rishi) + Aali (Home) and I bet you his home (Manali ;)) is just MAGICAL in nature.Manali suits the needs of every kind of travel mindset. A family looking for some bonding time, a couple for some peace and quiet, solo travellers for some solitude or a group of friends seeking an adventure.</p>
